Backend en·gi·neer from Brazil. I love open-source, and building cool products. When not programming I geek out on baking bread, photography, and dog lover. You can find more about me at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waldirborbajr/).

I'm a passionate Software Engineer who loves building great products.

I consider myself a [Generalizing Specialist](http://agilemodeling.com/essays/generalizingSpecialists.htm), with significant experience in NO-Code / Low-Code development and System Programming.

I’m product-oriented. Despite loving the technical side, I also deeply care about user experiences and design.

I love creating side-projects, you can see more here [projects](https://waldirborbajr.github.io/projects/).
